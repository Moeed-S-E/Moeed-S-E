## About Me
I'm a passionate developer who loves working with various programming languages and technologies. My interests include:

- **Linux**: I enjoy exploring different Linux distributions and customizing my environment.
- **C**: The classic language that powers so much of the software we use today.
- **Java**: Object-oriented programming at its best.
- **Python**: Great for scripting, automation, and data analysis.
- **Rust**: Safe, concurrent, and fast programming difficult for reverse engineering.
